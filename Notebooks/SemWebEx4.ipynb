    "# Preliminary: Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Another part of the RDF vocabulary we haven't touched on yet are collections. A collection is a **closed list** of elements. This means that once we have defined a collection, we can't add more elements. For this we use the terms **rdf:first**, **rdf:rest** and **rdf:nil**. To define a collection of the last members of band The Beatles:\n",

To close the collection, the rdf:rest property of the last element point to rdf:nil. Because this notation is very unreadable (even when using square brackets for blank nodes), there is syntactic sugar for defining collections. To define a collection we just write all its elements between parenthesis. For example, we define the same collection as above:\n",

    "# Data Modelling with OWL 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Before, we used RDF Schema to write simple ontologies. These ontologies have the advantage that there are only a few rules, which makes an automated inference relatively efficient. But RDF Schema has very limited expressivity. For example we can't express that a class can only have a certain cardinality of a specific property or that a class is the intersection of two other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Web Ontology Language (OWL)** is an ontology language like RDFS but can be used to model more complex concepts. OWL allows us to formulate expressions from **description logic** directly in RDF. As in RDFS, OWL defines three components: Individuals/Objects (concrete elements), Classes/Concepts (sets of objects) and Roles/Properties (which associate two individuals).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most properties defined in the RDFS vocabulary can also be used when writing an ontology using OWL. For example **rdfs:subClassOf**, **rdfs:subPropertyOf**, **rdfs:range** and **rdfs:domain** can all be used together with OWL and have the same semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on certain topics please consult the [OWL 2 Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/). In [Section 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#OWL_Syntaxes) you can change the syntax of the examples to turtle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "As in RDFS, we use **rdf:type** to declare that a resource belongs to a class. In OWL, the class of all classes is **owl:Class** so to declare that a resource is a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Professor a owl:Class .**\n",
    "\n",
    "**owl:Thing** is the class of everything (similar to rdfs:Resource) and **owl:Nothing** is the empty class. Both are predefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "OWL distinguishes between abstract roles, which are properties with resources as range, and concrete roles, which have a data type as range. The class of all abstract roles is **owl:ObjectProperty** and the class of all concrete roles is **owl:DatatypeProperty**. An example for both types of roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:belongsTo a owl:ObjectProperty ;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rdfs:range ex:Organisation .  \n",
    "ex:firstName a owl:DatatypeProperty ;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rdfs:range xsd:String .  \n",
    "ex:ProfDecker ex:belongsTo ex:I5 .  \n",
    "ex:ProfDecker ex:firstName \"Stefan\" .**\n",
    "\n",
    "ex:belongsTo is an abstract role because it has the class ex:Organisation as range. ex:firstName is a concrete role because it has the datatype xsd:String as range.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "As in RDFS, we can use **rdfs:subClassOf** to define class hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify that two classes are equivalent (contain the same individuals), OWL defines the property **owl:equivalentClass**. To define that the classes ex:Dog and ex:Dogs are equivalent, one would add the following triple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Dog owl:equivalentClass ex:Dogs .**\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify that two classes are disjoint (an individual from one class cannot belong to the other class), OWL defines the property **owl:disjointWith**. To define that the classes ex:Dog and ex:Cat are disjoint, one would add the following triple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Dog owl:disjointWith ex:Cat .**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another notation to easily specify pairwise disjointness of more than two classes. For this one uses the class **owl:AllDisjointClasses**, the property **owl:members** and a collection of classes in a blank node. To specify that ex:Dog, ex:Cat and ex:Horse are pairwise disjoint, one would add the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\[ rdf:type owl:AllDisjointClasses;  \n",
    "owl:members ( ex:Dog ex:Cat ex:Horse ) \\] .**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Property Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogous to classes, we can define property hierarchies with **rdfs:subPropertyOf**, equivalent properties with **owl:equivalentProperty** and disjoint properties with **owl:propertyDisjointWith** (or **owl:AllDisjointProperties** and **owl:member**).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify that a property is the inverse of another property with **owl:inverseOf**. To define that ex:owns is the inverse of ex:ownedBy, one would add the following triple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:own owl:inverseOf ex:ownedBy .**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Property Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In OWL there are also many classes to assign certain characteristics to properties. For example, to define that the property ex:knows is reflexive (everybody knows himself), one would use the class **owl:ReflexiveProperty**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:knows a owl:ReflexiveProperty .**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of all property classes in OWL 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Reflexive](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_ReflexiveObjectProperty): **owl:ReflexiveProperty**  \n",
    "[Irreflexive](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_IrreflexiveObjectProperty): **owl:IrreflexiveProperty**  \n",
    "[Symmetric](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_SymmetricObjectProperty): **owl:SymmetricProperty**  \n",
    "[Asymmetric](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_AsymmetricObjectProperty): **owl:AsymmetricProperty**  \n",
    "[Transitive](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_TransitiveObjectProperty): **owl:TransitiveProperty**  \n",
    "[Functional](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_FunctionalObjectProperty): **owl:FunctionalProperty**  \n",
    "[Inverse Functional](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_InverseFunctionalObjectProperty): **owl:InverseFunctionalProperty**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Concrete roles (owl:DatatypeProperty) can at most be functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "OWL does not make the assumption that different URIs are automatically different individuals. For example, let's say we have the functional property ex:father (everyone can have at most one father -> functional) but we have the two triples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Bart ex:father ex:Homer .  \n",
    "ex:Bart ex:father ex:HomerSimpson .**\n",
    "\n",
    "A reasoner that makes the unique-names assumption, would declare this graph as inconsistent because the ex:father property was earlier defined as functional (owl:FunctionalProperty). But an OWL reasoner does not make this assumption and instead infers that ex:Homer and ex:HomerSimpson are two names for the same individual. For this, OWL has two assertion properties, **owl:sameAs** and **owl:differentFrom**. To assert that ex:Homer and ex:HomerSimpson are the same person, one would add the following triple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Homer owl:sameAs ex:HomerSimpson .**\n",
    "\n",
    "Opposed to that, to assert that ex:Homer (greek author) and ex:HomerSimpson (cartoon character) are not the same person, one would add the following triple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Homer owl:differentFrom ex:HomerSimpson .**\n",
    "\n",
    "As with owl:AllDisjointClasses and owl:AllDisjointProperties, you can easily declare that multiple resources are pairwise different with **owl:AllDifferent** and **owl:member**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: owl:sameAs can be used on individuals and classes and means that two URIs are names for the same resource. owl:equivalentClass can only be used on classes and means that two classes contain the same individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negative Property Assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of assertion in OWL are negative property assertions. These types of assertions can be used to assert that a triple does not hold. The syntax for this assertion is similar to the syntax of RDF reification and uses the class **owl:NegativePropertyAssertion** as well as the three properties **owl:sourceIndividual**, **owl:assertionProperty** and **owl:targetIndividual** in a blank node. For example, to assert that ex:Homer (greek author) is **not** the father of ex:Bart, one would add the following triples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\[ a owl:NegativePropertyAssertion ;  \n",
    "owl:sourceIndividual ex:Bart ;  \n",
    "owl:assertionProperty ex:father ;  \n",
    "owl:targetIndividual ex:Homer \\] .**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that positive property assertions are just facts (simple triples).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 2: Exams [2 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an ontology about examiners and examinees using OWL 2 with the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three classes: examinees, examiners and examinants. All examinants are examiners and conversely. An examinee cannot be an examiner and conversely. To be examined by someone or being the examiner of someone are both abstract roles and inverses of each other. Only examiners can be the examiner of someone and only examinees can be examined by someone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following URIs:  \n",
    "Examiner: **http://example.org/#Examiner**  \n",
    "Examinant: **http://example.org/#Examinant**  \n",

    "You may also use all OWL 2 and rdfs terms mentioned above this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: In this and all following tasks, do not forget to assign classes like owl:Class and owl:ObjectProperty. The tests will check the non-entailed graphs. Even though some terms like rdfs:domain and rdfs:range originate from the RDFS vocabulary, they are still also a part of OWL 2.**"
