This folder contains only the **student versions** of the SemWebNotebooks, which do **not** include the unit tests used for automatic grading. Please contact `semweb [at] dbis (dot) rwth-aachen {dot} de` if you want to get a copy  the full notebooks.

For a nice introduction and feature overview, we recommend trying out the Jupyter-RDFify-Example.ipynb notebook. It will even guide you through the installation of Jupyter-RDFify if you haven't installed it already.
