Line magics, which only interpret the line, start with one percent sign (e.g. `%rdf`) and cell magics, which interpret both the line and the cell, start with two percent signs (e.g. `%%rdf`). The Jupyter-RDFify uses both but in some use-cases you need to use cell magics (e.g. for parsing turtle).\n",
